# dotfiles

## Requirements

Set zsh as your login shell:

    chsh -s $(which zsh)

## Install

Clone repository:

    git clone git://github.com/timstott/dotfiles.git

Install [rcm](https://github.com/thoughtbot/rcm):

    brew bundle

Install:

    rcup -d dotfiles -x README.md -x LICENSE

This will create symlinks for config files in your home directory. The
`-x` options, which exclude the `README.md` and `LICENSE` files, are
needed during installation but can be skipped once the `.rcrc`
configuration file is symlinked in.

You can safely run `rcup` multiple times to update:

    rcup

Make your own customizations
----------------------------

Put your customizations in dotfiles appended with `.local`:

* `~/.aliases.local`
* `~/.gitconfig.local`
* `~/.gvimrc.local`
* `~/.tmux.conf.local`
* `~/.vimrc.local`
* `~/.vimrc.bundles.local`
* `~/.zshrc.local`

For example, your `~/.aliases.local` might look like this:

    # Productivity
    alias todo='$EDITOR ~/.todo'

Your `~/.gitconfig.local` might look like this:

    [alias]
      l = log --pretty=colored
    [pretty]
      colored = format:%Cred%h%Creset %s %Cgreen(%cr) %C(bold blue)%an%Creset
    [user]
      name = Dan Croak
      email = dan@thoughtbot.com

Your `~/.zshrc.local` might look like this:

    # recommended by brew doctor
    export PATH="/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:$PATH"

Your `~/.vimrc.bundles.local` might look like this:

    Bundle 'Lokaltog/vim-powerline'
    Bundle 'stephenmckinney/vim-solarized-powerline'

What's in it?

[vim](http://www.vim.org/) configuration:

* [Ctrl-P](https://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim) for fuzzy file/buffer/tag finding.

  Rails file structure via `gf` and `:A` (alternate), `:Rextract` partials,
  `:Rinvert` migrations, etc.
